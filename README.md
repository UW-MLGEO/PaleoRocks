# Training Data
Our training data are a subset of 217 thin section images from member Lucy Helms. We will create code to generate random patches of size 200 x 200. We will work as a group to classify these images after reducing resolution to 10% of the origina, from 4000x6000 pixels to 400x600. We will then augment the data by rotating and reflecting these images after classifying.
