# Training Data
Our training data are a subset of 217 thin section images from member Lucy Helms. We will create code to generate random patches of size [pixel] x [pixel]. We will work as a group to classify these images after reducing resolution from 4000x6000 pixels to [insert size here]. We will then augment the data by rotating and reflecting these images after classifying.
